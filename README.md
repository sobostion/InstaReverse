# IG-reverse
A script to reverse image search Instagram photos.

Usage:

	python search.py <your username>

# what's the end goal? Have a web app where you enter your IG username, it will come up with some
# of your pictures, then you click a picture and it displays a grid of web page previews with the link underneath
# clicking pictures will lead you to the webpage
# and then it gives you the links to the pages on which it was found
# and maybe a screenshot preview of each page
# try host on AWS EBS
# maybe with lambda and docker

could use django or flask for web framework
